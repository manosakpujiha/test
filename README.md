|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Boundary Value Analysis**   | Handles edge cases for input fields like search or registration.                    | Test inputs at minimum, maximum, and just outside boundaries.                                             | Unit Testing, System Testing                                        |
| **Equivalence Partitioning**  | Tests valid/invalid inputs without redundancy.                                      | Group inputs into equivalence classes and test one from each.                                              | Unit Testing, Acceptance Testing                                    |
| **Decision Table Testing**    | Systematically evaluates all combinations of conditions and outcomes.               | Create decision tables for features like login or search filters.                                         | Integration Testing, System Testing                                 |
| **State Transition Testing**  | Ensures proper state changes (e.g., logged out → logged in).                        | Map states and transitions; test each action-triggered state change.                                      | System Testing, UI Testing                                          |
| **Use Case Testing**          | Tests key workflows, such as movie searching or watchlist updates.                  | Identify use cases, define steps, and validate outcomes.                                                  | Acceptance Testing, System Testing                                  |
| **Exploratory Testing**       | Identifies hidden issues through unscripted interactions.                           | Manually interact with the app and document unexpected behaviors.                                         | Usability Testing, System Testing                                   |
